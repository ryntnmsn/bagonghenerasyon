                The <b>BAGONG HENERASYON</b> is a non-stock, non-profit,
                non-government organization, a foundation and a party-list
                founded by Representative Bernadette “BH” Herrera-Dy. During her
                first campaign in 2001 as Quezon City Councilor, BH realized
                that a lot was asked of her in order to fully serve her
                constituents and meet their needs not just for a day but for a
                lifetime. Upon assuming her position, she realized that the
                government funds allocated to her as councilor will never be
                enough if she truly wanted to make a difference in the lives of
                the underprivileged and make it better. She then encouraged her
                brother Alexis,(now Councilor Kuya Alex Herrera of the first
                district of Quezon City) cousins Derrick Custodio and Victor
                Garcia (now Board Member of the Province of Aklan West) and good
                friend Bong Bustamante to join her and officially register
                Bagong Henarasyon Foundation, Inc. with the Securities and
                Exchange Commission in January 9, 2003. They adopted the name of
                the NGO that the supporters of BH formed in February 2001, the
                Bagong Henerasyon, Inc. which has actually started the projects
                of the foundation as the NGO registered with SEC as well. The
                name Bagong Henerasyon coined by her supporters embodies BH for
                who she really is – a young, dynamic and sincere public servant
                who will bring in fresh ideas, find new ways of delivering
                services and create sustainable programs that will enable the
                citizenry to be productive members of society.<br />
                <br />
                In 2009, BH Foundation authorized the application for
                accreditation at the COMELEC as a Party-list organization
                representing the youth and women of our country and with then QC
                Councilor Bernadette Herrera-Dy as its first nominee. Upon
                approval of the COMELEC in January 2010, Bagong Henerasyon BH
                Party-list was born! In May 2010, it won the 2010 National
                Elections as the 16th party-list proclaimed to have a seat in
                the House of Representatives.<br /><br />

                A “public servant for the new generation” best describes
                Congresswoman Bernadette “BH” Herrera-Dy. A public servant who
                is setting the example for a new batch of young politicians
                whose primary motivation is the passion for service, not
                political ambition.<br /><br />

                Prior to becoming a councilor, she has no prior background in
                politics, but as she grew up, she was constantly exposed to the
                plight of the less fortunate-in her community, school, church,
                and civic-oriented groups where she was a member of. She was
                inspired by her father’s experience who was once a newspaper boy
                who survived all the hardships and challenges because of
                opportunities given to him by friends and family. She has always
                given it her best “To give back to society what society has
                given you.”, as taught by her parents while she and her siblings
                were growing up. It was only through the support of former
                President Corazon Aquino, who endorsed her to then Mayor and now
                Speaker Sonny Belmonte, that BH considered running for a seat in
                the Quezon City Council, way back 2001.<br /><br />

                Three terms after and first term in congress, with role models
                President Cory and Speaker SB, BH has been honed as a seasoned
                councilor and a very active neophyte congresswoman who attempts
                to digress from the stereotype, managing to accomplish more than
                what was expected of her. From putting up a mobile computer
                school to establishing livelihood projects for women to
                delivering health services to the indigents and empowering them
                through information, BH has found a new calling and rose up
                eagerly to the challenge. In the sea of dirty politics and
                depressing situations, BH emerges as a breath of fresh air, a
                new symbol of hope and definitely a bright star. This petite and
                charming lady legislator proving to all and sundry that yes,
                there is hope for the new generation, our Bagong Henerasyon!
